# Programming-Ques

1.With a given integral number n, write a program to generate a dictionary that contains (i, i*i) such that is an integral number between 1 and n (both included). and then the program should print the dictionary. Suppose the following input is supplied to the program: 8 Then, the output should be: {1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25, 6: 36, 7: 49, 8: 64}

Answer: 

number = int(input("Type a number: "))

numberDict = {}
for i in range(1, number+1):
    numberDict[i] = i*i

print(numberDict)


2.	Define a class which has at least two methods:
getString: to get a string from console input
printString: to print the string in upper case.


Answer:

class IOString():
    def __init__(self):
        self.str1 = ""

    def get_String(self):
        self.str1 = input()

    def print_String(self):
        print(self.str1.upper())

str1 = IOString()
str1.get_String()
str1.print_String()

Input:

ash7win

Output: 

ASH7WIN
